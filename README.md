# graphics
Learning a bit about graphics with OpenGL and C. I will be using SDL2 to make
things a bit easier in terms of creating a window, etc., but all of the
graphics will be done with OpenGL functions in core profile mode. The final
dependency is GLAD, which is a cross-platform way for me to load the OpenGL
function addresses.
